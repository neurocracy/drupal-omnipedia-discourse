# Why open source?

We're dismayed by how much knowledge and technology is kept under lock and key
in the videogame industry, with years of work often never seeing the light of
day when projects are cancelled. We've gotten to where we are by building upon
the work of countless others, and we want to keep that going. We hope that some
part of this codebase is useful or will inspire someone out there.

# Requirements

* [Drupal 9.5 or 10](https://www.drupal.org/download) ([Drupal 8 is end-of-life](https://www.drupal.org/psa-2021-11-30))

* PHP 8

* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

# Installation

## Composer

### Set up

Ensure that you have your Drupal installation set up with the correct Composer
installer types such as those provided by [the `drupal/recommended-project`
template](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/starting-a-site-using-drupal-composer-project-templates#s-drupalrecommended-project).
If you're starting from scratch, simply requiring that template and following
[the Drupal.org Composer
documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/starting-a-site-using-drupal-composer-project-templates)
should get you up and running.

### Repository

In your root `composer.json`, add the following to the `"repositories"` section:

```json
"drupal/omnipedia_discourse": {
  "type": "vcs",
  "url": "https://github.com/neurocracy/drupal-omnipedia-discourse.git"
}
```


### Patching

This provides [one or more patches](#patches). These can be applied automatically by the the
[`cweagans/composer-patches`](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches/tree/1.x)
Composer plug-in, but some set up is required before installing this module.
Notably, you'll need to [enable patching from
dependencies](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches/tree/1.x#allowing-patches-to-be-applied-from-dependencies) (such as this module ü§ì). At
a minimum, you should have these values in your root `composer.json` (merge with
existing keys as needed):


```json
{
  "require": {
    "cweagans/composer-patches": "^1.7.0"
  },
  "config": {
    "allow-plugins": {
      "cweagans/composer-patches": true
    }
  },
  "extra": {
    "enable-patching": true,
    "patchLevel": {
      "drupal/core": "-p2"
    }
  }
}

```

**Important**: The 1.x version of the plug-in is currently required because it
allows for applying patches from a dependency; this is not implemented nor
planned for the 2.x branch of the plug-in.

### Installing

Once you've completed all of the above, run `composer require
"drupal/omnipedia_discourse:1.x-dev@dev"` in the root of your project to have
Composer install this and its required dependencies for you.
